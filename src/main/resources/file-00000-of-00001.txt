     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
  Reg. Sir, I am made

  Reg. Not altogether so.
  Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
  Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,
  Reg. And in good time you gave it!
     With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?
  Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.
  Reg. What need one?
  Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's people
  Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
  Reg. O, sir, to wilful men
     My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.       
  Reg. Why is this reason'd?
  Reg. Sister, you'll go with us?
  Reg. 'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.
  Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.

  Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King
  Reg. Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
  Reg. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
                                       [Regan plucks his beard.]
  Reg. So white, and such a traitor!
  Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.
  Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
  Reg. And false.
  Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-
  Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?
  Reg. One side will mock another. Th' other too!
  Reg. How now, you dog?
  Reg. What do you mean?
  Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
  Reg. Out, treacherous villain!
  Reg. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
     Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.

  Reg. In my rights
  Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets.
  Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
  Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
  Reg. Sick, O, sick!
  Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but

  Lear. Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her
  Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!
  Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.
  Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,
             Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.
  Reg. I am glad to see your Highness.
  Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
     Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,
     Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied
     With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!
  Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
  Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least
  Reg. O, sir, you are old!
  Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.
  Lear. [rises] Never, Regan!
  Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me
  Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
  Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.
  Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,
  Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
     O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
  Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
                 The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.
     And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
  Reg. My sickness grows upon me.

Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, [Edmund the] Bastard, and
  Reg. Hang him instantly.
                Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.
  Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
  Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?
  Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights
  Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.
  Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
     [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your
Enter, with Drum and Colours, Edmund, Regan, Gentleman, and
  Reg. Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
  Reg. Now, sweet lord,
  Reg. But have you never found my brother's way
  Reg. I am doubtful that you have been conjunct 
  Reg. I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,
Enter Regan and [Oswald the] Steward.
  Reg. But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?
  Reg. Himself in person there?
  Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
  Reg. What might import my sister's letter to him?
  Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
  Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.
  Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
  Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;
  Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.
  Reg. Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.
